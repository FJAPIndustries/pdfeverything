<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 30 January 2026</p>

<p>
PDFEverything ("the App") is a PDF editing application designed to allow users to view,
edit, annotate, and manage PDF documents. Your privacy is important to us.
This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
PDFEverything does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit personal information to external servers.
All document processing occurs locally on your device unless explicitly stated otherwise.
</p>

<h3>a. Files and Documents</h3>
<p>
The App requires access to files on your device in order to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open and display PDF documents</li>
  <li>Edit, annotate, or modify PDF files</li>
  <li>Save edited PDFs back to your device</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your files remain on your device and are not uploaded, shared, or analyzed by us.
</p>

<h3>b. Device Permissions</h3>
<p>
PDFEverything may request the following permissions, which are standard for PDF editing applications:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Storage / Files access</strong> – to read and save PDF documents</li>
  <li><strong>Media access</strong> – to import images into PDFs (if supported)</li>
  <li><strong>Camera access</strong> – to scan documents or capture images for PDF creation (if enabled)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These permissions are used solely to provide core app functionality.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>
We do not:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect personal identifiers (such as name, email address, or phone number)</li>
  <li>Track user location</li>
  <li>Monitor user activity outside the App</li>
  <li>Sell or share data with third parties</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
PDFEverything does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.
If this changes in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Because PDFEverything processes files locally on your device, you retain full control
over your data. We recommend protecting your device with appropriate security measures
such as a lock screen and keeping your operating system up to date.
</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
PDFEverything does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under
the age of 13. The App is intended for general productivity use.
</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on
this page with an updated effective date.
</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
<p>
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the App,
please contact the developer via the PDFEverything GitHub repository.
